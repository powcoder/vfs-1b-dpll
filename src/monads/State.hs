-- The State monad:
-----------------------------------------------------------
-- Many computations require some internal state to be 
-- tracked. Since Haskell doesn't have stateful computation
-- out of the box, we require a different way to express this.
--
-- `State s a` is a monad that encapsulates a computation 
-- which has some state `s` and computes `a`. To elaborate, 
-- `Reader s` is the `m` in monad `m a`.
--
-- State, as Reader and Writer, is kind of a misnomer for
-- the monad. The monad is in fact not a State, but a
-- computation that modifies the State in some way.
-- (try to come back to this sentence later if this doesn't
-- make sense now!)
--
-- There is probably no need to argue why state would
-- be useful as it is so ubiquitous in programming.
-- Just to name some examples though, games have some state
-- of their world, online shopping has state within their
-- shopping carts, etc.
--
-- Consider the following function
-- fn :: State Bool Int
-- fn = ...
--
-- Here, `fn` is a computation that has some state Bool and
-- returns an Int.
-- 
-- To read from the state, one can use `get`. For example,
-- fn :: State Bool Int
-- fn = do
--   bool <- get
--   ...
--
-- `get` places the state as the output of the monad. e.g.
-- get fn :: State Bool Bool
--
-- Then we can monadically bind the environemnt to actually
-- read it:
-- fn' = get fn >>= \bool -> ...
--
-- We do recommend do notation as it reads quite a bit nicer.
--
-- As an aside, notice how `get` is equivalent to `ask` from 
-- the Reader monad (apart from working on different monads).
--
-- Apart from reading from the state, we also need a way to
-- write back to the state. For this, we have `put` which we
-- can use as follows:
-- fn :: State Bool Int
-- fn = do
--   bool <- get
--   ...
--   put True
--   ...
--
-- We can of course compose and evaluate Stateful operations
-- runState (fn >> fn) False
